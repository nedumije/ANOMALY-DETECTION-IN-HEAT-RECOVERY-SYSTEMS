# Anomaly Detection in Heat Recovery Systems: A Machine Learning Approach

PROJECT OVERVIEW


This project focuses on the development of a machine learning pipeline for detecting anomalies in a process heat recovery system using time-series sensor data. Anomalies in such systems can indicate inefficiencies, potential equipment failures, or suboptimal operating conditions. Early detection of these anomalies enables proactive maintenance, fault diagnosis, and process optimization, ultimately improving system reliability and reducing operational costs.The project leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques, primarily the Isolation Forest algorithm, to identify data points that deviate significantly from normal operational behavior. A secondary model, the Local Outlier Factor (LOF), was also evaluated for comparison. The pipeline is implemented in a reproducible, well-documented Jupyter Notebook and includes a saved model for deployment.

REPOSITORY CONTENTS

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The primary objective of this project is to detect anomalous behavior in a heat recovery system using time-series sensor data. Anomalies may represent critical events, such as equipment malfunctions, sensor failures, or process inefficiencies, which could lead to costly downtime or safety hazards if not addressed promptly.


KEY GOALS

A. Develop a robust, step-by-step machine learning pipeline for anomaly detection.
B. Train and evaluate unsupervised machine learning models to identify anomalies in the dataset.
C. Provide a reproducible framework that can be adapted for similar time-series anomaly detection tasks.
D. Serialize the trained model for integration into a production environment for continuous monitoring.

The unsupervised approach was chosen due to the lack of labeled anomaly data, which is common in industrial settings where anomalies are rare and difficult to annotate.


METHODOLOGY

The project follows a structured 11-step data science pipeline to ensure a systematic and rigorous approach to anomaly detection. Each step is designed to address specific aspects of the problem, from data preparation to model deployment.

1. PROBLEM DEFINITION

The problem is defined as detecting anomalies in a heat recovery system using unsupervised machine learning. Anomalies are data points that deviate significantly from normal operational patterns, potentially indicating faults or inefficiencies.

2. DATA ACQUISITION

The dataset (heat_recovery_anomaly_detection_dataset.csv) contains time-series sensor readings from a heat recovery system. The data includes multiple features, such as temperature, pressure, and performance metrics, collected over time.

3. DATA EXPLORATION

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to:

A. Understand the dataset’s structure, including feature types (numerical, categorical, temporal) and dimensions.

B. Identify missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.

C. Visualize temporal trends and correlations between sensor readings using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

5. DATA PREPROCESSING

Preprocessing steps included:

A. Converting timestamp columns to a consistent datetime format for time-series analysis.

B. Handling missing values through imputation or removal, depending on their extent.

C. Addressing inconsistencies, such as erroneous sensor readings, to ensure data quality.

7. FEATURE SELECTION

Relevant features were selected based on their physical significance to the heat recovery system (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow rates). Feature importance was assessed through correlation analysis and domain knowledge to focus on metrics most indicative of system health.6. Data ScalingSince machine learning algorithms like Isolation Forest are sensitive to feature scales, all numerical features were normalized using StandardScaler from Scikit-learn. This ensures that features with different units (e.g., temperature in °C, pressure in kPa) contribute equally to the model.


8. MODEL SELECTION

Two unsupervised machine learning models were evaluated:

A. ISOLATION FOREST: Chosen as the primary model due to its efficiency in high-dimensional datasets and its ability to isolate anomalies by recursively partitioning the data. The algorithm assumes anomalies are “few and different,” making them easier to isolate.

B. LOCAL OUTLIER FACTOR (LOF): Evaluated as a secondary model to compare density-based anomaly detection. LOF identifies anomalies based on local density deviations, which can be effective for detecting clustered outliers.

10. MODEL TRAINING

The Isolation Forest model was trained with the following configuration:

A. CONTAMINATION PARAMETER: Set to 0.01 (1% of the data is expected to be anomalous), based on domain knowledge and iterative experimentation.

B. RANDOM STATE: Fixed for reproducibility.

The LOF model was also trained with varying parameters (e.g., n_neighbors) to explore its performance.

12. ANOMALY DETECTION AND PREDICTION

The trained Isolation Forest model was used to classify data points as:

A. NORMAL (labeled as 1): Data points consistent with typical system behavior.

B. ANOMALOUS (labeled as -1): Data points that deviate significantly from normal patterns.

The LOF model was similarly applied to classify data points based on local density.

14. EVALUATION AND VISUALIZATION

Results were evaluated using:

A. QUANTITATIVE METRICS: The proportion of detected anomalies was compared to the expected contamination rate.

B. VISUALIZATION: Time-series plots were generated to highlight detected anomalies against normal data points. Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to create clear, interpretable visualizations, such as anomaly-flagged time-series and scatter plots of key features.

C.COMPARISON: The Isolation Forest model successfully identified anomalies, while the LOF model detected no anomalies under the tested parameters, suggesting that anomalies in this dataset are not density-based.

15. CONCLUSION AND DEPLOYMENT

Key findings were summarized, and the trained Isolation Forest model was serialized using joblib (isolation_forest_model.joblib) for deployment. 

Deployment considerations include:

A. Integrating the model into a real-time monitoring system for continuous anomaly detection.

B. Establishing thresholds for anomaly scores to balance sensitivity and specificity.

C. Periodic retraining to adapt to evolving system behavior.



RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

A. ISOLATION FOREST PERFORMANCE

The Isolation Forest model effectively identified anomalies, with the number of detected anomalies aligning closely with the specified contamination rate (0.01).
Visualizations confirmed that detected anomalies corresponded to significant deviations in sensor readings, such as sudden spikes or drops in temperature or pressure.
The model’s sensitivity can be tuned by adjusting the contamination parameter, allowing domain experts to balance false positives and false negatives based on operational requirements.

B. LOCAL OUTLIER FACTOR (LOF) PERFORMANCE

The LOF model, with the tested parameters, failed to detect any anomalies. This suggests that the anomalies in the dataset are not characterized by local density variations, which LOF is designed to detect.

Further tuning of LOF parameters (e.g., n_neighbors, distance metrics) may improve its performance, but Isolation Forest appears better suited for this task.

MODEL DEPLOYMENT

The serialized Isolation Forest model (isolation_forest_model.joblib) enables seamless integration into a production environment. The model can process new sensor data in real-time, providing immediate anomaly alerts for operational teams. The lightweight nature of the Isolation Forest algorithm ensures scalability for large-scale industrial applications.

NEXT STEPS

To enhance the project and prepare it for real-world deployment, the following steps are recommended:

A. LOF INVESTIGATION:

Conduct a deeper analysis of the LOF model’s failure to detect anomalies. Experiment with a broader range of parameters (e.g., n_neighbors, metric) and alternative density-based algorithms, such as DBSCAN. Assess whether LOF could complement Isolation Forest for detecting specific types of anomalies.

B. THRESHHOLD OPTIMIZATION:

Develop a thresholding strategy for Isolation Forest anomaly scores to optimize the trade-off between false positives and false negatives. If labeled anomaly data becomes available, supervised validation can be used to fine-tune thresholds. Explore dynamic thresholding based on operational context or system state.

C. FEATURE ENGINEERING:

Create derived features, such as moving averages, rates of change, or statistical aggregates (e.g., variance over a time window), to capture subtle anomalies that may not be evident in raw sensor data. Incorporate domain-specific features, such as energy efficiency ratios, to enhance model performance.

D. REAL TIME MONITORING:

Integrate the model into a real-time monitoring system using streaming data pipelines (e.g., Apache Kafka, MQTT).
Implement alerts and dashboards to notify operators of detected anomalies in real-time.

E. MODEL RETRAINING:

Establish a retraining schedule to ensure the model adapts to changes in system behavior over time, such as equipment wear or process modifications.
Explore online learning techniques to update the model incrementally with new data.

F. VALIDATION WITH DOMAIN EXPERTS:

Collaborate with heat recovery system engineers to validate detected anomalies against known operational issues.
Incorporate feedback to refine feature selection and model parameters.
